# Repo for beta version of the NHK World TV Kodi plug-in

You can install a beta version of the plugin by installing the [NHK World TV Development Kodi Repository](https://github.com/sbroenne/kodirepo/tree/master/repository.sbroenne). The plug-in will auto-update itself regularly.

**Kodi 19 has been released so the dev repo now contains the Matrix version of the plug-in**

I am currently submitting the add-on to the official repo so hopefully, you will not need this repo for a much longer period.

You can find the latest version of the 18.6+ plugin here [Releases](https://github.com/sbroenne/plugin.video.nhkworldtv/releases/download/v0.0.149/plugin.video.nhkworldtv-0.0.149.zip)

You can also manually download [the plug-in as a ZIP file](https://github.com/sbroenne/kodirepo/tree/master/plugin.video.nhkworldtv). In this case, you will need to manually peforms updates.
