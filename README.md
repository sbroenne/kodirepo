# NHK World TV plug-in Repository

You can install the latest stable version of the [NHK World TV plugin](https://github.com/sbroenne/plugin.video.nhkworldtv). for **Kodi Matrix (19) and newer** by downloading this [ZIP file](https://github.com/sbroenne/kodirepo/raw/main/repository.sbroenne/repository.sbroenne-0.0.14.zip).

Once you download the ZIP file, install it as ZIP file in Kodi. You need to trust add-ons from unknown services for this to work.

Once the repo has been installed you can then install the plugin from there. It will auto-update itself after each release.
